# threeP.games
An interface and graphical-interface to package game development projects written in python with the PyGame and Panda3D engines.

This is the very early stages of a work in progress, but there is a YouTube tutorial playlist that accompanies its development so I wanted to get it shared on here quickly. Instructions for using it will be coming soon...
