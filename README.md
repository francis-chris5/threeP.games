# threeP.games
An interface and graphical-interface to package game development projects written in python with the PyGame and Panda3D engines.

This is the very early stages of a work in progress, but there is a YouTube tutorial playlist that accompanies its development so I wanted to get it shared on here quickly. Instructions for using it will be coming soon...

Script documentation generated with doxygen available at: https://francis-chris5.github.io/threeP.games/html/index.html


I forgot to list all the dependencies as I was making this, but I know that in addition to the core Python API I at least used:

<blockquote>
      
      https://www.pygame.org/wiki/GettingStarted (engine used for 2d games)
      https://www.panda3d.org/ (engine used for 3d games)
      https://docs.panda3d.org/1.10/python/tools/model-export/converting-from-blender (I chose second link: https://github.com/Moguri/panda3d-gltf)
      https://www.wxpython.org/pages/downloads/ (graphical user interface package used)
      https://inkscape.org/ (GUI has button to open this)
      https://www.blender.org/ (GUI has button to open this)
      
   </blockquote>
